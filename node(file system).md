## node js installation ##

## Windows/MacOS ##
 
1. Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts.

## Linux ##
Open your terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

You can verify the installation by running:


node -v
npm -v
## **NPM (Node Package Manager)** ##

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows you to install and manage third-party packages.

Installing a Package
To install a package, use the npm install command:

npm install package
Using a Package
Once installed, you can use the package in your Node.js application:
 ```js
 
 const express = require('package');
 const app = express();
  const express = require('express');
 const app = express();
 
 app.get('/', (req, res) =  {
   res.send('Hello, World!');
 });
 
 app.listen(3000, () =  {
   console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
 });
 
 ```


## **Node REPL** ##

Node.Js REPL or Read-Evaluate-Print Loop is an interactive shell for the Node.js environment which means we can write any valid Javascript code in it.
```bash
tanu@diksha:~$ node
```

 Welcome to Node.js v20.15.0.
 
 Type ".help" for more information.


## **Process** ##
Process-This object provides information about, and control over,the currrnt Node.js process.
``` bash
tanu@diksha:~$ node
```

Welcome to Node.js v20.15.0.

Type ".help" for more information.


```bash
> process.version
```
'v20.15.0'
```bash
> process.release
```

{
  name: 'node',

  lts: 'Iron',

  sourceUrl: 'https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.15.0/node-v20.15.0.tar.gz',

  headersUrl: 'https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.15.0/node-v20.15.0-headers.tar.gz'

}


Process.argv-returns an array containing the command-line arguments passed when the Node.js process
was launched.
```bash
tanu@diksha:~$ node
```

Welcome to Node.js v20.15.0.

Type ".help" for more information.

```bash
> process.argv
```

[ '/home/tanu/.nvm/versions/node/v20.15.0/bin/node' ]


## **Hello World Example** 

Let's create a simple "Hello World" program using Node.js.

Create a new file named app.js.

Add the following code:


   ```js
   let n = 5;
   for(let i=0; i<n; i++);{
   console.log("hello world");
   }
   ```
Run node file name:

Example:

```bash
node app.js
```

Open your node REPL "Hello World".

## **Export in File**
require() - a bulit-in function to include external modules that exist in separte file.

module.exports- a special object.

**example usage to export in file**

file name math.js
```js
const sum = (a,b) => a+b;
const mul = (a,b) => a*b;
const g = 9.8;
const PI = 3.14;
module.export = 123; //to export information to another file.
```
file name app.js
```js
const somevalue = require("./math"); // same dir to require file
console.log(somevalue);
```
run node file name app.js and require value math.js.
## **Export in Directories**

**example usage export dir**

dir name- student information > student1
          student information > student2
 ```js
// student1
module.export = {
name: "Diksha",
Roll no: "123",
};        
```
```js
// student1
module.export = {
name: "Tanusha",
Roll no: "124",
};        
```

To import the information of a directory into a file, a file named index.js has to be created and the execution starts from the node server uss file and the information is exported there.

```js
//index.js
const student1 = require("./student1");
const student1 = require("./student2");
```
let info = [student1,student2];

module.export = info;
```js
// app.js
const info = require("./student information")
console.log(info);
```
run server app.js
## **Installing Package**
npm is the standrad package manager for node.js

npm install <-package name->
## **package.json**

The package.json file contains descriptive and functionl metadata about a project,such
as a name version and dependencies.
npm init

## **Local v/s Global**

npm install -g <-package name->

npm install <-package name->

## **import module**
import {sum} from "./math.js"
We can't selectively load only the pieces we need with require but import,we can 
selectively load only the pieces we need, which can save memmory.
loading synchronous for 'reruire' but can be asynchronous for 'import'.
```js
//math.js
//
export const sum = (a,b) => a+b;
export const sum = (a,b) => a*b;
export const g = 9.8;
export const PI = 3.14;
```
```js
//app.js
import{sum, PI} from "./math.js";
console.log(1,2);
```
run server but given output error it define package.json type module.
## **What is Express**
A Node.js web application framework that helps us to make web application 
it is used for server side programming.

**express uses in server side program**

1.listen for incomming request.
2.pass request.
3.match responce with routes.
4.responce send.

```
 npm install express
```
**Getting Started With Express**
example usage in express
```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

let port = 8080;

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`app is listening on port $(port)`);

});
```
Port - port the logical endpoint of a network connection that is used to exchange
information between a web server and a web clint.
##  **Handling requests**

Node. js is a powerful way to handle incoming requests and send responses to clients. We can handle different HTTP methods, set response status codes and status messages, write response headers and body, and end the response process with response. end().
**exampel usage in handling requests**

  app.use
  ```js
  app.use((req.res) => {
  console.log("new incoming request");
  });
 ```
  **Routing**
  it is process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple network.
  ```js
  app.get("apple",(req,res) => {
  res.send({
  name: "apple",
  color: "red",
  }):
  });
 ```
 **Installing Nodemon**
 
 To automatically restart server with code changes.
 ```
 npm insatll -g Nodemon // install globally
 ```
**Path Parameters**

 Path parameters are elements embedded directly within the URL path of an API request that acts as a placeholder for specific  
 values. They are utilized for targetting and identifying unique resources within the API.
 
 req.params
 ```js
 app.get("/id/:username",(req.res) =>{
 let { username } = req.params;
 res.send(`This account belongs to @${username}`);
 });
```
**Query String**
req.query
```js
app.get("/search",(req,res) =>{
let {q} = req.query;
if(!Q){
res.send("No search query");
}
res.send (`This are the results for:${Q}`);
});

```  
## **Conclusion**

Node.js is a powerful platform for building server-side applications using JavaScript. With its non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture, it is ideal for building scalable and efficient applications.
