## Wnat is NodeJs ?

_Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts._

## why do you use node js

Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to create scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Here are some reasons why we use Node.js:

1. Fast and Scalable: Node.js is designed to handle high-traffic and high-concurrency applications, making it an excellent choice for real-time web applications, such as chatbots, gaming, and live updates.

2. Event-Driven, Non-Blocking I/O: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows developers to write asynchronous code that can handle multiple requests simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness.

3. Cross-Platform: Node.js is a cross-platform runtime, meaning it can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

4. Large Ecosystem: Node.js has a massive ecosystem of packages and modules available through npm (Node Package Manager), making it easy to find and integrate libraries and tools for various tasks.

5. JavaScript Everywhere: Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript on both the client-side (browser) and server-side, making it a consistent and efficient choice for full-stack development.

6. Real-Time Capabilities: Node.js is well-suited for real-time applications that require immediate updates, such as live updates, live streaming, and real-time analytics.

7. Easy to Learn: Node.js is built on JavaScript, which is a widely known and popular programming language, making it relatively easy for developers to learn and adapt.

8. High Performance: Node.js is designed to handle high-performance applications, making it an excellent choice for applications that require fast response times and high throughput.

9. Cost-Effective: Node.js is an open-source technology, which means it is free to use and distribute, reducing costs and making it an attractive choice for startups and enterprises alike.

10. Wide Adoption: Node.js is widely adopted by many popular companies, including LinkedIn, Netflix, Uber, and Walmart, making it a reliable and well-established technology.

In summary, Node.js is a powerful and versatile technology that offers many benefits, including fast and scalable performance, cross-platform compatibility, a large ecosystem, and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of applications.

## node js instalion

sudo apt install curl
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y node js
node --version


## **Synchronous** **vs** **Asynchronous**

Every method in fs module have synchronous as well as asynchronous form.
Asynchronous methods takes a lastparameter as completion function
callback and firstparameter of the callback function is error. Itis
preferred to use asynchronous method instead of synchronous method as
former never block the program execution where as the second one does.

**Example**

Create a textfile named **input.txt** having following content

> Tutorials Point is giving self learning content to teach the world in
> simple and easy way!!!!!

Letus create a js file named **main.js**having the following code.

> var fs = require("fs");
>
> // Asynchronous read
>
> fs.readFile('input.txt', function (err, data) { if (err) {
>
> return console.error(err); }
>
> console.log("Asynchronous read: " + data.toString()); });
>
> // Synchronous read
>
> var data = fs.readFileSync('input.txt'); console.log("Synchronous
> read: " + data.toString());
>
> console.log("Program Ended");

Now run the main.js to see the result:

```
node main.js
```

Verify the Output

> Synchronous read: Tutorials Point is giving self learning content to
> teach the world in simple and easy way!!!!!
>
> Program Ended
>
> Asynchronous read: Tutorials Point is giving self learning content to
> teach the world in simple and easy way!!!!!

Following section will give good examples on major File I/O methods.

## **Open** **a** **File**

**Syntax**

Following is the syntax of the method to open a file in asynchronous
mode:

> fs.open(path, flags\[, mode\], callback)

### **Parameters**

Here is the description of the parameters used:

> **path** - This is string having file name including path.
>
> **flags**- Flag tells the behavior of the file to be opened. All
> possible values have been mentioned below.
>
> **mode**- This sets the file mode *permissionandstickybits*, butonly
> if the file was created. Itdefaults to 0666, readable and writeable.
>
> **callback**- This is the callback function which gets two arguments
> *err*, *fd*.

**Flags**

Flags for read/write operations are:

**Example**

Letus create a js file named **main.js**having the following code to
open a file input.txtfor reading and writing.

> var fs = require("fs");
>
> // Asynchronous - Opening File console.log("Going to open file!");
> fs.open('input.txt', 'r+', function(err, fd) {
>
> if (err) {
>
> return console.error(err); }
>
> console.log("File opened successfully!"); });

Now run the main.js to see the result:

> \$ node main.js

Verify the Output

> Going to open file!
>
> File opened successfully!

## **Get** **File** **information**

**Syntax**

Following is the syntax of the method to getthe information abouta file:

> fs.stat(path, callback)

## **Parameters**

Here is the description of the parameters used:

> **path** - This is string having file name including path.
>
> **callback**- This is the callback function which gets two arguments
> *err*, *stats* where **stats**is an objectof fs.Stats type which is
> printed below in the example.

Apartfrom the importantattributes which are printed below in the
example, there are number of useful methods available in
**fs.Stats**class which can be used to check file type. These methods
are given in the following table.

## **Example**

Letus create a js file named **main.js**having the following code:

> var fs = require("fs");
>
> console.log("Going to get file info!"); fs.stat('input.txt', function
> (err, stats) {
>
> if (err) {
>
> return console.error(err); }
>
> console.log(stats);
>
> console.log("Got file info successfully!");
>
> // Check file type
>
> console.log("isFile ? " + stats.isFile());
>
> console.log("isDirectory ? " + stats.isDirectory()); });

Now run the main.js to see the result:

> \$ node main.js

Verify the Output

> Going to get file info! { dev: 1792,
>
> mode: 33188, nlink: 1, uid: 48, gid: 48, rdev: 0,
>
> blksize: 4096, ino: 4318127, size: 97, blocks: 8,
>
> atime: Sun Mar 22 2015 13:40:00 GMT-0500 (CDT), mtime: Sun Mar 22 2015
> 13:40:57 GMT-0500 (CDT), ctime: Sun Mar 22 2015 13:40:57 GMT-0500
> (CDT) }
>
> Got file info successfully! isFile ? true
>
> isDirectory ? false

## **Writing** **File**

**Syntax**

Following is the syntax of one of the methods to write into a file:

> fs.writeFile(filename, data\[, options\], callback)

This method will over-write the file if file already exists. If you
wantto write into an existing file then you should use another method
available.

**Parameters**

Here is the description of the parameters used:

> **path** - This is string having file name including path.
>
> **data**- This is the String or Buffer to be written into the file.
>
> **options**- The third parameter is an objectwhich will hold
> {encoding, mode, flag}. By default encoding is utf8, mode is octal
> value 0666 and flag is 'w'
>
> **callback**- This is the callback function which gets a single
> parameter err and used to to return error in case of any writing
> error.

**Example**

Letus create a js file named **main.js**having the following code:

> var fs = require("fs");
>
> console.log("Going to write into existing file");
> fs.writeFile('input.txt', 'Simply Easy Learning!', function(err) {
>
> if (err) {
>
> return console.error(err); }
>
> console.log("Data written successfully!");
>
> console.log("Let's read newly written data"); fs.readFile('input.txt',
> function (err, data) {
>
> if (err) {
>
> return console.error(err); }
>
> console.log("Asynchronous read: " + data.toString()); });
>
> });

Now run the main.js to see the result:

> \$ node main.js

Verify the Output

> Going to write into existing file Data written successfully!
>
> Let's read newly written data Asynchronous read: Simply Easy Learning!

## **Reading** **File**

**Syntax**

Following is the syntax of one of the methods to read from a file:

> fs.read(fd, buffer, offset, length, position, callback)

This method will use file descriptor to read the file, if you wantto
read file using file name directly then you should use another method
available.

**Parameters**

>
> **length** - This is an integer specifying the number of bytes to
> read.
>
> **position** - This is an integer specifying where to begin reading
> from in the file. If position is null, data will be read from the
> currentfile position.
>
> **callback**- This is the callback function which gets the three
> arguments, *err*, *bytesRead*, *buffer*.

**Example**

Letus create a js file named **main.js**having the following code:

> var fs = require("fs");
>
> var buf = new Buffer(1024);
>
> console.log("Going to open an existing file"); fs.open('input.txt',
> 'r+', function(err, fd) {
>
> if (err) {
>
> return console.error(err); }
>
> console.log("File opened successfully!"); console.log("Going to read
> the file");
>
> fs.read(fd, buf, 0, buf.length, 0, function(err, bytes){ if (err){
>
> console.log(err);
>
> }
>
> console.log(bytes + " bytes read");
>
> // Print only read bytes to avoid junk. if(bytes \> 0){
>
> console.log(buf.slice(0, bytes).toString()); }
>
> }); });

Now run the main.js to see the result:

> \$ node main.js

Verify the Output

> Going to open an existing file File opened successfully! Going to read
> the file
>
> 97 bytes read
>

> other than a possible exception are given to the completion callback.

**Example**

Letus create a js file named **main.js**having the following code:

> var fs = require("fs");
>
> var buf = new Buffer(1024);
>
> console.log("Going to open an existing file"); fs.open('input.txt',
> 'r+', function(err, fd) {
>
> if (err) {
>
> return console.error(err); }
>
> console.log("File opened successfully!"); console.log("Going to read
> the file");
>
> fs.read(fd, buf, 0, buf.length, 0, function(err, bytes){ if (err){
>
> console.log(err); }
>
> // Print only read bytes to avoid junk. if(bytes \> 0){
>
> console.log(buf.slice(0, bytes).toString()); }
>
> // Close the opened file.
>
> fs.close(fd, function(err){ if (err){
>
> console.log(err); }
>
> console.log("File closed successfully."); });
>
> }); });

Now run the main.js to see the result:

> \$ node main.js

Verify the Output

> Going to open an existing file File opened successfully! Going to read
> the file
